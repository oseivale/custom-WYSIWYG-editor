# custom-WYSIWYG-editor

Implementing a way to fetch and display the content of the live website within the WYSIWYG editor UI.
Providing editing capabilities for the displayed content, including text editing, image uploading, and formatting options.
Handling real-time synchronization between the edited content in the WYSIWYG editor and the live website.
Managing authentication and permissions to ensure that only authorized users can make changes.
Dealing with complexities such as responsive design, dynamic content, and interactivity of the live website.

#######

Fetch Contentful Content: Use Contentful's Delivery API to fetch the content (e.g., text, images, structured data) that you want to display in your live preview editor.

Render Content in Editor: Build a React component that renders the fetched content in a WYSIWYG editor UI. You can use existing libraries like Draft.js or Slate.js to create the editor interface. Map the fetched content from Contentful to the appropriate components or editor elements.

Enable Editing: Implement editing capabilities within the editor, such as text editing, image uploading, and formatting options. You may need to create custom UI components or integrate with existing libraries to support these features.

Real-time Preview: As users make edits in the editor, update the preview in real-time to reflect those changes. You can achieve this by handling events triggered by user actions (e.g., typing, formatting) and updating the preview accordingly.

Integration with Contentful: If users want to save their edits back to Contentful, implement logic to send the updated content to Contentful's Content Management API (CMA) to update the corresponding entries. Ensure that you handle authentication and authorization properly to authenticate with Contentful's APIs securely.

Previewing Content: Provide a way for users to preview their changes before saving them to Contentful. This could involve rendering the edited content in a separate preview area within the editor UI.

Testing and Optimization: Test your custom live preview editor thoroughly to ensure it works as expected with different types of content and user interactions. Optimize the performance and user experience to provide a seamless editing experience.

By following these steps, you can create a custom live preview editor for Contentful content using ReactJS, allowing users to edit and preview content fetched from Contentful's Delivery API before saving it back to Contentful if desired.

#######

Setup React Project: Set up a new React project using Create React App or your preferred method.

Install Dependencies: Install any necessary dependencies for your WYSIWYG editor. You might use libraries like Draft.js, Slate.js, or Quill.js for building the editor interface.

Create Editor Component: Create a React component for your WYSIWYG editor. This component will render the editor interface and handle user interactions.

Implement Basic Editing Features: Implement basic editing features such as text formatting (bold, italic, underline), text alignment, lists, and maybe image insertion. You can refer to the documentation of the chosen editor library for guidance on implementing these features.

Add Preview Area: Add a preview area to your editor UI where users can see the live preview of their edits. This area should update in real-time as users make changes in the editor.

#######

We're fetching an entry from Contentful using the getEntry method of the Contentful client.
The useEffect hook ensures that the content is fetched only once when the component mounts.
Once the content is fetched, it is set into the component's state using setContent.
The fetched content is then displayed in the textarea and the preview area of the editor.

Handle User Interactions: Implement event handlers to capture user interactions with the editor, such as typing, formatting text, inserting images, etc. Update the preview area accordingly based on these interactions.

Styling: Apply styles to your editor components to make them visually appealing and user-friendly.

Testing: Test your editor thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected and provides a smooth editing experience for users.
